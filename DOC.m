%Calculate the DOC of the input data X
%Yogev Yonatan, yogev.yn@gmail.com
% X- input data, rows of X correspond to species,
% columns of X correspond to observations.
% 
% dissimilarit_mode - The dissimilarity metric:
% 'e' for Euclidean distance
% 'rjsd' for root Jensenâ€“Shannon divergence
% 'spearman' for Spearman distance
%
% overlap_vector and dissimilarity_vecotr are the output overlap and
% dissimilarity values between each pair of observations, respectievly.
